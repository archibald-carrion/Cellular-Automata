# Programmable cellular automaton
This project is a programmable cellular automaton written in Python using the Pygame GUI library.
The project is based on the concept of cellular automaton, which is a grid of cells that evolve over time based on a set of rules.
Each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of a cell is determined by the states of its neighbors.
